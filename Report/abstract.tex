In recent years, considerable number of big data systems emerged for
 large-scale data analyis following MapReduce. 
Most of the systems can handle the big volume of data if the analytic query 
itself is not complex.
In this paper, we would like to study how these systems perform against complex
queries. We consider the query is complex if the query has the following 
properties: 1) the query is iterative and cannot be done in a single round
of communication. 2) the query contains aggregates or UDFs which are widely
used for data analytics. 3) the query processes significant amount of data.
We proposed a benchmark consisting of a collection of such queries and
evaluated these queries on state-of-art representive big data systems in
its catagory. We think this emprical evaluation and analysis could be 
beneficial to the development of next generation big data systems.
