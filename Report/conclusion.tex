\section{Conclusion}

We defined a benchmark which considering three important properties of modern
complex analytic queries. We evaluated three state of art big data systems 
which have different data model and programming abstraction over our benchmark
using the same instance setting in EC2. We discuss the pros and cons of these
systems and reported our experience on deploying and using these three systems.
