\subsection{Q1: LCA}
This query is to compute the least common ancestor (LCA) of two 
academic papers. An ancestor of paper $p$ is transitively defined as:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Any paper that $p$ cites is an ancestor of $p$
    \item Any paper that $p$'s ancestor cites is an ancestor of $p$
\end{enumerate} 

Given two paper $p_1$ and $p_2$, if their sets of ancestors are 
$a(p_1)$ and $a(p_2)$, their common ancestors are 
$a(p_1) \cap a(p_2)$. We define the distance from a common ancestor
as $d(a_1, p_1, p_2) = max(dist(a_1, p_1), dist(a_1, p_2))$, where 
$dist(a_1, p_1)$ is the minimum number of citation hops from $a_1$ to 
$p_1$. Then we can define a total ordering among the common ancestors
of $p_1$ and $p_2$ as, if $a_i, a_j \in a(p_1) \cap a(p_2)$, 
$a_i \prec a_j$ if and only if.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $d(a_i, p_1, p_2) < d(a_j, p_1, p_2)$.
    \item $d(a_i, p_1, p_2) = d(a_j, p_1, p_2)$ and the year when $a_i$
    published $year(a_i)$ is earlier than $a_j$'s $year(a_j)$.
    \item if $d(a_i, p_1, p_2) = d(a_j, p_1, p_2)$ and $year(a_i) = year(a_j)$, $a_i$'s paper id is a smaller number than $a_j$'s.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Q2: K-Core}
The query is to compute the k-core (or k-degenerate graph) of an undirected 
graph. It is firstly defined by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal 
as color number \cite{ErdosH66}. K-core is an important structural property
and has been studied extensively in network analytics \cite{Alvarez-HamelinDBV05NIPS, ChengKCO11ICDE}.
