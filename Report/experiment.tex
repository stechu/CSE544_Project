\section{Experimental Evaluation}

We report the experimental result of running three benchmark queries from 
Section~\ref{sec:benchmark}. We deployed the three systems in Amazon EC2 using 
the identical configuration, which uses 1 master node and 16 slave nodes.
Each node is a m3.large instance which has 2 vCPU, 7.5 GB RAM and 32GB SSD 
storage. We used the most up to date version of the 3 systems that we can get:
Myria (Daily built in Mar 10, 2015, commit: 90d85cd), Spark (1.2.1 release) and
GraphLab (Open sourced version in GitHub, commit: 18c2103).
